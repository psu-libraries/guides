# Guides

Guides for getting things done, programming well, and programming in style.

* [Style](style)

Fundamentals:

* No feigning surprise
* No well-actually's
* No back-seat driving
* No subtle-isms

High level guidelines:

* Be consistent.
* Don't rewrite existing code to follow this guide.
* Don't violate a guideline without a good reason.
* A reason is good when you can convince a teammate.

A note on the language:

* "Avoid" means don't do it unless you have good reason.
* "Don't" means there's never a good reason.
* "Prefer" indicates a better option and its alternative to watch out for.
* "Use" is a positive instruction.
